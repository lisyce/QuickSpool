# [WIP] QuickSpool: An App to Track Your Embroidery Floss

## About

This project surfaced when I wanted to start cataloging my own embroidery floss collection and didn't want to go search through my bobbins every time I wanted to know how much of a color I owned. The most popular methods were either spreadsheets that were clunky to use on mobile devices or phone apps that weren't accessible on my computer. But, most importantly: setup took forever.

This application is designed to combat these issues by introducing quick, auto-completed ways to add popular thread brands in bulk, filter and sort them, and easily export that collection if you ever want to go back to a traditional spreadsheet. Planned features also include shopping lists (and adding your new haul with the click of a button) and a space to plan your projects.

The UI is designed for both desktop and mobile screens, so it's easy to take to the store without sacrificing usability. Never buy more thread than you need for a project again! (Or do... I won't judge).
